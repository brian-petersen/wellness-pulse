# Wellness Pulse

OPTED FOR GOOGLE SURVEYS INSTEAD. ARCHIVING IN CASE I RETURN TO THIS
IN THE FUTURE.

Mental health is important! Keeping a pulse on it helps you remain
objective and on track. If times are tougher than normal, reaching
for outside help can help.

## Design

Sends out a monthly survey across various topics correlated with
mental wellness and a sense of well being: self-regulation,
self-awareness, empathy, purpose, etc.

Survey results are tracked overtime. Can be displayed as a chart.
